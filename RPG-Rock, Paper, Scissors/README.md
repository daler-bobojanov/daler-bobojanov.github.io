# RPG- "Super Mario Rock, Paper, Scissors" -Game-Proposal.

## *Rules:*

### Quick Start:

* 'Mario' meets 'Spiny' in 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' battle!

    This is a two players game that resembles 'Super Mario', that incorporates 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game! I used Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
    I do not own any of the images. I hope you enjoy my game.

### Detailed Instructions:

*   Upon page load, players are given instructions on how to play the game;
*   Once both players are ready, a 'Start Game' button must be pressed. A new page will render with main game board;
*   'Mario' and 'Spiny' game characters will face each other in 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' battle;
*   Upon game start, each player must move towards the center of the Main-game-board where there are three tools/weapons ready to be picked-up. Rock, Paper, and Scissors;
*   Once players pick-up the tool/weapon of their choice, they must chase one other to define a round winner;
*   Expected outcomes: Rock beat Scissors, Paper beat Rock, Scissors beat Paper;
*   There are also a few obstacle objects laid out on the Main-game-board that players can utilize as to hide behind;
*   Game ends once a player with an advantage tool catches the player with disadvantage tool;
*   Players given a choice to end the game (will take to landing page) or reset and continue playing;
